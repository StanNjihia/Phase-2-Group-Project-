# 🎬 Data-Driven Insights for a Modern Film Studio

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to guide a new entrant in the movie production industry using data-driven insights. Our team explored various factors influencing the financial and audience success of movies by analyzing historical movie datasets from sources such as Box Office Mojo and IMDb.

With the evolving landscape of content consumption—particularly the rise of streaming services—understanding the determinants of a movie's performance is crucial. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to uncover patterns that can inform strategic production and marketing decisions.

## 🧠 Business Understanding

The global movie industry has shifted dramatically with changes in consumer behavior, streaming trends, and content platforms. This project addresses key business questions:

- What attributes are associated with higher box office returns?
- How do online ratings correlate with audience engagement?
- What is the optimal runtime that aligns with high viewer satisfaction?

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLite for database queries
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting
- CSV files from Box Office Mojo, IMDb, and other relevant datasets

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Final_Combined_Group_Project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis.
- `Data/`: Contains raw and cleaned datasets used in the project.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation (this file).

## 📈 Key Insights

- The "sweet spot" runtime for most positively rated films lies between **40 and 180 minutes**.
- Online audience ratings (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes) often correlate with box office success, though not always causally.
- Certain genres tend to perform better financially or critically, depending on the release platform and season.
